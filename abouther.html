She is currently studying in sjsu, and major in Digital Media Art (DMA). Her grandfather was a calligraphy lover, a collector of traditional Chinese paintings and her cousin is engaged in art. In this artistic family background, she was exposed to the art culture when she was young. When she was in high school, she decided to choose art as her major. Gradually she was attracted to art and persevered. Most of her inspiration comes from life. She likes to try different types of art. After a semester of Digital Media learning experience, she is now more interested in glitch art.
