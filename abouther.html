            Hi, my name is Mengshi Chen. I lived in China for 18 years and moved to the United States with my parents four years ago. My grandfather was a Calligrapher and my cousin is engaged in art. In this artistic family background, I was exposed to the art culture when I was young. When I was in high school, I decided to choose art as my major. The more I explore art the more I'm attracted to it. Most of my inspiration comes from nature, so my video main body is about nature or the surrounding environment. Up to now, all my video art is finished with premiere pro. Some were produced and recorded with kantan mapping and then cut with premiere pro. I also do some photography and I printed my work as a book. All my video art is about expressing my love of nature and discovering the beauty of my surroundings.

            With our group project as the representative. “Wanderlust”, this video is based on my personal thoughts. In our discussion that most of our existing footages come from the scenery we found when driving to school or driving. On the other hand, we don't have time to shoot more videos, so we propose to use my driving video as our main content. The video that we used was recorded the sunset from my Iphone while I was in my boyfriend’s car. However, if we show my driving video directly, it will make the whole project very simple. Therefore, we decided to use what we learned to make a diversity video. At the beginning, I chose Kantan Mapping as the main body of my creation, because I thought we were doing a video exhibition, and I wanted to let my audiences have a sense of themselves in the car. Sometimes when I am in a driving car, I feel dizzy. I want to create the “dizzy feeling” to show my emotion, so I decided to make a shape of rotating windmill mapping. In my imagination, multi channel represents three projector systems in reality. If our video can put a large space in the gallery, I think it will bring more resonance to the audience. As I said, all of my video footages came from my daily life and being recorded on my phone, because I think that's how I felt and the beauty I found at the moment. I want to convey my feelings and thoughts through video or photos, so I will upload my works on my official Instagram or YouTube channel. I want more people to know our living environment, and I hope my works can inspire them to explore the beauty around them.
